   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Detects user emotions (e.g., "worried," "confused") and adjusts responses empathetically.
   - **Memory**: Remembers user interests (e.g., if you ask about passwords, it recalls this for future replies).
   - **Multimedia**: Plays a welcome sound and displays colorful ASCII art on startup.. Technical Features**:  
   - **Typewriter Effect**: Text appears gradually for a conversational feel.
   - **Color-Coded UI**: Uses different colors for the bot, user, warnings, and info.
